# Xenomai 3 Excercises
*I Found these Xenomai 3 exercises I completed and wrote up for a project a few years ago. Decided to put it up onto git in case anyone else finds this useful.*

Use this [website](http://www.cs.ru.nl/lab/xenomai/) to get up to speed on the basics of Xenomai and RTOS programming in general. Iâ€™ll be doing these exercises and placing my solutions in this folder along with write-ups on the solutions. Good luck.
